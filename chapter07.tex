\TeX\ can perform an implicit \indextermsub{number}{conversion} from a string
\cstoidx number\par\cstoidx romannumeral\par
of digits to an integer. Conversion from a representation
in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal notation was
treated above. The conversion the other way,
from an \gr{internal integer} to a printed representation,
has to be performed explicitly.
\TeX\ provides two conversion routines,
\cs{number}, to decimal, and \cs{romannumeral} to
\indexterm{roman numerals}.
The command \cs{number} is equivalent to \cs{the}
when followed by an internal integer.
These commands are performed in the expansion processor of \TeX, that is,
they are expanded whenever expansion has not been inhibited.

%Both commands
%yield a string of tokens with category code~12\index{category!12};
%their argument is a~\gr{number}.
%Thus \verb-\romannumeral51-, \verb-\romannumeral\year-,
%and~\verb-\number\linepenalty- are valid, and so is \verb-\number13-.
%Applying \cs{number} to a denotation has some uses:
%it removes leading zeros and superfluous plus and minus signs.

%A roman numeral is a string of lowercase `roman digits',

%The sequence\howto Uppercase roman numberals\par
%\begin{verbatim}
%\uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral ...}
%\end{verbatim}
%gives uppercase roman numerals.
%This works because \TeX\  expands
%tokens in order to find the opening brace of the argument

%a negative number, the result is simply empty.
